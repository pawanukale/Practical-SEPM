# 💻 Practical No-05: Modeling Data Flow Diagram & Control Flow Diagram

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Experiment:
To understand and model the flow of **data** and **control** in a **Gym Management System** using **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)** and **Control Flow Diagrams (CFD)**.

---

## 📘 Introduction:
Every system requires a clear understanding of how data flows from one component to another.  
- **DFD (Data Flow Diagram)** helps visualize the **movement and transformation of data**.
- **CFD (Control Flow Diagram)** shows the **control logic** of the system.

This experiment focuses on creating both diagrams to represent the Gym Management System.

---

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Identify and represent **external entities** interacting with the system.
- Show how **data flows** between processes and data stores.
- Build **Data Flow Diagrams** reflecting system functionality.
- Model **control logic** using Control Flow Diagrams.

---

## ✅ Learning Outcomes:
After this experiment, you will be able to:
- Identify external entities and functionalities in a system.
- Map how data flows across various processes.
- Visually represent the system using **DFD** and **CFD**.

## 📚 Theory

### ➤ Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
A **graphical tool** that shows how data flows within a system.

#### 🔹 Graphical Notations:
| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| ○ or ◯ | **Process** | e.g., Register Member |
| → | **Data Flow** | e.g., Member Info |
| =▭▭▭= | **Data Store** | e.g., Member Database |
| ▢ | **External Entity** | e.g., Member, Trainer |

---

## 🔁 Context Diagram (DFD - Level 0)
Shows the system as a **single process** with interactions from external entities.

## 🧮 Level 1 DFD – Expanded Processes

| Process              | Description                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Register Member      | Member submits details → Stored in DB           |
| Assign Trainer       | Admin assigns trainer based on goals/schedule   |
| Track Attendance     | Tracks member login & attendance timings        |
| Record Payments      | Manages membership fees & billing               |
| Generate Reports     | Creates summaries of progress, attendance, etc. |

## 🎛️ Control Flow Diagram (CFD)

A **Control Flow Diagram** emphasizes:
- **Order of operations**
- **Conditions**
- **Branching or loops**

---

## 🧪 Simulation (Optional):
Use these tools to simulate and draw DFDs/CFDs:
- **Lucidchart**
- **Draw.io**
- **Visual Paradigm**
