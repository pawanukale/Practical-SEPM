# Gym Management System

## Objective
To design and develop a Gym Management System that simplifies the management of a gym’s day-to-day operations like registration, subscription, attendance, and trainer allocation using a digital platform.

## Introduction
In today’s fast-paced world, fitness has become a necessity. With increasing numbers of people joining gyms, it becomes important for gym owners to maintain and manage records efficiently. Traditional record-keeping involves manual processes that are prone to errors, data loss, and mismanagement.

The Gym Management System provides a computerized solution to these problems. It maintains all member details, subscription plans, trainer allocations, and attendance records in a centralized system. This helps staff and management deliver better services with improved accuracy and efficiency.
