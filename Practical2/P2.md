# 💻 Practical No: 02 – Software Project Estimation

## 🧪 A. Aim of the Experiment
To estimate the cost, effort, and duration of a software project using project estimation techniques like **COCOMO** and **Halstead’s Complexity Metrics**.

---

## 📌 B. Problem Definition
**Identifying the Requirements from Problem Statements**

In this experiment, we aim to understand and apply techniques to estimate the overall cost, effort, and duration required for developing a **Gym Management System**. This involves:

- Analyzing the problem statement
- Identifying key modules and functionalities
- Choosing an appropriate estimation model (COCOMO or Halstead’s)
- Meeting the gym’s business objectives effectively

---

## 📚 C. Introduction

A **Gym Management System** is a software solution that automates the operations of a gym. This includes:

- Member registration and profile management  
- Attendance tracking (QR/manual)  
- Trainer allocation and scheduling  
- Workout and diet plans management  
- Membership and payment tracking  
- Reports and analytics

Estimation helps in planning and resource allocation **before development begins**.

## 🎯 D. Objectives

- To gather software requirements from the problem statement.  
- To understand and apply project estimation techniques.  
- To analyze the estimated effort, time, and cost using COCOMO and Halstead’s Metrics.  
- To identify advantages and limitations of estimation techniques.

## 📐 E. Project Estimation Techniques

### (a) COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)

- Estimates based on KLOC (thousand lines of code)
- Gives **Effort (person-months)**, **Development Time**, and **Cost**

**Types of COCOMO:**
- Basic COCOMO
- Intermediate COCOMO
- Detailed COCOMO

**Formulas:**

- Effort (E) = `a × (KLOC)^b`  
- Development Time (D) = `c × (E)^d`

> **Example:**  
> For a Gym Management System estimated at **5 KLOC** (Basic Project):  
> `Effort = 2.4 × (5)^1.05 ≈ 13.2 PM`  
> `Time = 2.5 × (13.2)^0.38 ≈ 6.7 months`

**Advantages:**
- Simple and historical  
- Good for high-level planning

**Drawbacks:**
- Needs accurate size estimate  
- Less accurate for new projects

### (b) Halstead’s Complexity Metrics

Estimates based on **operators and operands** in code.

**Terms:**
- `n1`: distinct operators  
- `n2`: distinct operands  
- `N1`: total operators  
- `N2`: total operands  

**Formulas:**
- Program Length: `N = N1 + N2`  
- Vocabulary: `n = n1 + n2`  
- Volume: `V = N × log2(n)`  
- Effort: `E = V / λ`

**Advantages:**
- Code-based estimation  
- Helps in complexity analysis

**Drawbacks:**
- Needs code  
- Doesn’t factor design or UX

---

## 🧪 F. Simulation (Optional)

Use COCOMO calculators or manual formulas to simulate estimation if tools are unavailable.

## 📊 G. Case Study – Gym Management System

**Modules Involved:**
- Member Management  
- Attendance Tracking  
- Trainer Scheduling  
- Payment and Billing  
- Workout/Diet Planning

**Estimation Example:**

- Project Size: 5 KLOC  
- Project Type: Organic  
- Constants: `a = 2.4`, `b = 1.05`, `c = 2.5`, `d = 0.38`  

**COCOMO Calculation:**

- Effort = `2.4 × (5)^1.05 ≈ 13.2 PM`  
- Time = `2.5 × (13.2)^0.38 ≈ 6.7 months`

---

## ✅ H. Conclusion

We applied software estimation techniques to the **Gym Management System** project. Using **COCOMO** and **Halstead’s Metrics**, we calculated size, effort, and time.

**Takeaways:**
- Estimations help in budgeting, planning, and resourcing  
- Combining models gives a clearer picture  
- Each method has pros and cons
