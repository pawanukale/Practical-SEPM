# 🎯 Practical No-07: Modeling Sequence Diagrams

---

## 🧪 Aim of the Experiment
To understand and draw **sequence diagrams** for modeling the interactions between objects in a system over time, specifically for a **Gym Management System**.

---

## 📝 Introduction
A **Sequence Diagram** is a UML interaction diagram that shows how processes (objects) operate and communicate with one another over time.  
It is used to:
- Model the **dynamic behavior** of a system.
- Emphasize **time-ordered message flows**.
- Represent how **actors interact** with **system components**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
Upon completion, you will be able to:
- Identify the **sequence of object interactions**.
- Represent **life-lines** and **activation bars**.
- Understand **synchronous** vs. **asynchronous** messages.
- Draw sequence diagrams accurately from a system use case.

## 📚 Theory

### 🔷 Sequence Diagram
A **Sequence Diagram** models the **order of message exchange** among objects to accomplish a specific task or use case.

### 📦 Elements in a Sequence Diagram

| Element        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Actor**      | External entity interacting with the system                                 |
| **Object**     | An instance of a class participating in the interaction                     |
| **Lifeline**   | Vertical dashed line showing an object’s existence during interaction       |
| **Activation** | Thin rectangle over lifeline indicating the object's active duration        |
| **Message**    | Arrow showing communication between objects                                 |

---

## 📉 Lifeline Bar
- Starts when the object is created.
- Ends when the object is destroyed (optionally shown with an "X").
- Appears as a **dashed vertical line** under the object.

## 📨 Message Types

| Type                  | Description                                                                 | Arrow Representation      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Synchronous Message** | Waits for a response before continuing (blocking)                         | ➤ Solid arrowhead          |
| **Asynchronous Message** | Sends a message and continues without waiting for a reply (non-blocking) | ➤ Stick arrowhead          |

**Examples**:
- `getTrainerDetails()` → Synchronous  
- `sendReminderEmail()` → Asynchronous

## 💡 Example: Gym Management System – Sequence Diagram

### 📌 Use Case: Member Books a Training Session

#### 👥 Actors & Objects:
- **Member** (Actor)
- **GymSystem** (Object)
- **SessionManager** (Object)
- **Trainer** (Object)
- **PaymentGateway** (Object)

---

### 🧭 Flow of Interactions:

1. **Member** logs into the system.
2. Sends **request to book a session** to **GymSystem**.
3. **GymSystem** forwards request to **SessionManager**.
4. **SessionManager** checks **Trainer** availability.
5. If available, **SessionManager** confirms session booking.
6. **Member** makes **payment** via **PaymentGateway**.
7. **GymSystem** sends **confirmation** message.
