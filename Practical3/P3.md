# 💻 Practical No: 03 – Project Scheduling and Resource Allocation

## 🧾 1. Introduction

**Project:** Gym Management System (Web/Mobile Application)  
**Objective:** Build and deploy a Gym Management System within **6 months** to help gym owners manage:

- Member registrations  
- Attendance tracking  
- Trainer schedules  
- Payments  
- Workout and diet plans

### 🔧 Importance of Scheduling
Proper scheduling ensures:
- Timely project delivery  
- Optimal use of human and technical resources  
- Prevention of development bottlenecks  
- Tasks are completed in logical order without idle time

---

## 📋 2. Task Identification

### ✅ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The development flow is structured as:

1. Requirements Gathering  
2. System Design  
3. Frontend Development  
4. Backend Development  
5. Testing  
6. Deployment  
7. Maintenance

> Each task is dependent on the previous one for smooth execution.

### 🔗 Task Dependencies
- **Testing** starts only after frontend & backend are completed  
- **Deployment** begins only after successful testing  
- **Maintenance** follows deployment for support, updates, and fixes

---

## 👨‍💻 3. Resource Scheduling

### 🛠️ Resources Needed

#### ➤ Frontend Development
- 2 Developers  
- 1 UI/UX Designer  
- **Tools**: Figma, React or Flutter  

#### ➤ Backend Development
- 3 Developers  
- **Tools**: Node.js or Django, MySQL or PostgreSQL  

#### ➤ Testing
- 2 Testers  
- **Tools**: Selenium, Postman, Manual Testing Plans  

---

### 👥 Allocation Strategy

- **Frontend Devs**: Work on UI (login, dashboard, check-ins)  
- **Backend Devs**: APIs, database, authentication, payments  
- **Testers**: Perform unit, integration, and UAT testing

## 🗓️ 4. Creating the Gantt Chart

| Task                  | Sub-Tasks                               | Duration       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Requirements Gathering| Client meetings, feature listing         | Week 1         |
| System Design         | UI mockups, DB schema, system architecture| Week 2         |
| Frontend Development  | Login, dashboard, workout screens        | Weeks 3–5      |
| Backend Development   | APIs, DB connections, user roles         | Weeks 3–6      |
| Testing               | Unit, integration tests, bug fixing      | Weeks 6–7      |
| Deployment            | Server setup, app hosting                | Week 8         |
| Maintenance           | Bug fixes, minor upgrades                | Ongoing (Post Wk 8) |

> A Gantt chart can visually track this timeline (let me know if you'd like me to generate one for you).

## 📈 5. Monitoring

### 📅 Weekly Updates
- Weekly status meetings  
- Team members report:
  - Current progress
  - Issues faced
  - Upcoming goals

### 🔄 Adjusting Timeline
- Delays in one task (e.g., backend) will shift dependent tasks (e.g., testing)  
- Buffer periods or resource reallocation may be used to compensate

---

## ✅ 6. Conclusion

### 📊 Gantt Chart Effectiveness
- Visualizes the timeline  
- Highlights dependencies  
- Tracks progress in real-time  

### 🕒 Importance of Scheduling
- Efficient developer/tester usage  
- Maintains quality by providing testing time  
- Prevents resource conflicts and overlaps
