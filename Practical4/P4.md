# ðŸ’» Practical No-04: UML Use Case Diagrams and Capturing Use Case Scenarios

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
Modeling **UML Use Case Diagrams** and **Capturing Use Case Scenarios**

---

## ðŸ§ª Aim of the Experiment:
To learn how use cases and actors are identified and how various use cases relate to each other within a system.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction:
A **Use Case Diagram** offers a shared understanding among end-users, stakeholders, and domain experts. It describes the **system behavior** in terms of available **functionalities (use cases)** and the **users (actors)** who interact with those functionalities.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:
By the end of this practical, you will be able to:
- Identify various **actors** and **use cases** from a problem statement.
- Understand and represent different **relationships** among use cases.
- Draw a comprehensive **Use Case Diagram**.

---

## ðŸ“š Theory

### âž¤ Use Case Diagrams:
- Capture **dynamic behavior** of a system.
- Show **interactions between users and the system**.

### âž¤ Actors:
- **Primary Actor**: Initiates interaction (e.g., Gym Member)
- **Supporting Actor**: Assists in completing interactions (e.g., Admin, Trainer)

### âž¤ Use Case:
A task or goal that the system performs in response to a user interaction.

### âž¤ Graphical Representation:
- **Actor** â†’ Stick figure  
- **Use Case** â†’ Oval  
- **Relationships** â†’ Lines connecting actors and use cases

## ðŸ”— Use Case Relationships:

| Type         | Description                                                            | Example                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Include**  | Reusable functionality used in multiple use cases                      | Login is included in all modules   |
| **Extend**   | Optional behavior under certain conditions                             | Generate Report extends View Data  |
| **Generalization** | One actor or use case inherits behavior of another               | Admin inherits from User           |

## ðŸŽ­ Actors in Gym Management System:
- **Gym Member**
- **Admin**
- **Trainer**
- **Receptionist**

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases:
- Register  
- Login  
- Book Session  
- Cancel Session  
- View Progress  
- Update Schedule  
- Manage Members  
- Generate Reports

---

## ðŸ“š Case Study: Gym Management System

A Gym Management System allows:
- Members to **register**, **login**, **book sessions**, and **view progress**  
- Trainers to **update schedules** and track **member progress**  
- Admins to **manage memberships**, **generate reports**, and oversee trainers  
- System maintains **reports** and other admin-level functionalities
