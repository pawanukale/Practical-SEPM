# 🧪 Software Testing Theory

## 📌 Software Testing
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets the specified requirements. It involves executing software/system components using manual or automated tools to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements.

## 🔍 Verification and Validation

- **Verification**: The process of checking whether the software meets the design specifications.  
  _"Are we building the product right?"_

- **Validation**: Ensures that the developed software fulfills the intended use and meets the customer requirements.  
  _"Are we building the right product?"_

## 📋 Standards for Software Test Documentation

Proper documentation ensures that testing processes are traceable, reproducible, and standardized. Common standards include:

- **IEEE 829** (Test Documentation Standard)
- **IEEE 1008** (Unit Testing Standard)

A well-documented test suite should include:

- Test Plan  
- Test Cases  
- Test Scripts  
- Bug Reports  
- Traceability Matrix

## 🧰 Testing Frameworks

Testing frameworks provide an environment for executing test scripts and evaluating results. They often include tools for:

- Automation of tests  
- Report generation  
- Code coverage  
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Examples**:  
- `JUnit`  
- `TestNG`  
- `PyTest`  
- `Selenium`  
- `NUnit`

## 🎯 Need for Software Testing

- To ensure the product is free from defects and performs as expected  
- To improve the quality and reliability of the software  
- To reduce development costs by detecting bugs early  
- To ensure customer satisfaction and compliance with business requirements

## 🧪 Test Cases and Test Suite

- **Test Case**: A set of conditions or variables under which a tester determines whether a software system or part of an application is working correctly.
- **Test Suite**: A collection of test cases that are intended to be used together for testing a software program.

Each test case typically includes:

- Test Case ID  
- Description  
- Pre-conditions  
- Test Steps  
- Expected Result  
- Actual Result  
- Status (Pass/Fail)

## 🧪 Types of Software Testing

### ✅ Unit Testing
Tests individual components or modules of a system to validate each part independently. It is often automated and written by developers.

### 🔄 Integration Testing
Checks the data flow and interaction between integrated units/modules. It ensures that modules work together as expected.

### 🧩 System Testing
Evaluates the complete and fully integrated software product. It tests the system’s compliance with specified requirements.
