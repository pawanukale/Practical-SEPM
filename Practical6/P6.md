# ðŸ’» Practical No-06: Modeling UML Class Diagrams

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim of the Experiment
To model the **structure and behavior** of the **Gym Management System** using **UML class diagrams**, and to represent the associations between different entities involved in the system.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
A **UML Class Diagram** provides a visual representation of the **classes**, their **attributes**, **methods**, and **relationships** in an object-oriented system.

In this experiment, we model the internal structure of a Gym Management System. Key components include classes such as:
- `Member`
- `Trainer`
- `Equipment`
- `Payment`
- `Session`
- `Gym`

This helps visualize and design the systemâ€™s **architecture** and interactions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
By the end of this experiment, you will be able to:
- Graphically represent a **class** and its **associations**.
- Understand the **logical flow** and structural design of a system.
- Analyze and model **inter-class relationships** through **UML class diagrams**.

## ðŸ“š Theory

### ðŸ”¸ Structural vs Behavioral Aspects
- **Structural**: Refers to the static part of the system like class name, attributes, and methods.
- **Behavioral**: Deals with class relationships such as **association**, **generalization**, and **composition**.

## ðŸ“¦ Class Diagram Basics

### âž¤ Elements in Class Diagram

| Element     | Symbol         | Description                                    |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Class       | Rectangle (3 parts) | Class name, attributes, operations         |
| Attribute   | `+`, `-`, `#`   | Public, Private, Protected members            |
| Operation   | `method()`     | Functions that the class can perform          |
| Association | Line           | Shows relation between classes                |
| Generalization | Triangle Arrow | Inheritance (is-a)                           |
| Composition | Filled Diamond | Strong ownership (has-a)                      |
| Aggregation | Empty Diamond  | Weak ownership (part-of)                      |

### ðŸ“Ž Relationships:

| Relationship                | Type         | Example                                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Gym has Trainers            | Composition  | Deleting Gym deletes Trainers                      |
| Gym has Equipments          | Composition  | Gym owns the Equipment                             |
| Member pays Payment         | Association  | Member â†’ Payment                                   |
| Trainer conducts Session    | Association  | Trainer â†’ Session                                  |
| Member books Session        | Association  | Member â†’ Session                                   |
